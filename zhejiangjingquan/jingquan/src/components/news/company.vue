              <h3>Precautions for use of stainless steel water tank</h3>
              <p>Stainless steel water tank is a new generation of water tank product after FRP water tank. Its product is made of SUS304 stainless steel plate by precision molding, with beautiful shape, economic and practical, and long-term main body. Stainless steel water tank has many advantages, such as light weight, high strength, corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance, clean water quality, anti-seepage, anti-seismic, no moss, easy installation, no maintenance, easy cleaning, etc. Although the stainless steel water tank has many advantages, the following should be paid attention to in daily use: 1. As the secondary equipment for storing domestic water, the stainless steel water tank can only contain domestic water (fire water), not hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or liquid with large acid and alkaline content. 2. During the use of the water tank, do not place other heavy equipment on the top of the water tank, do not knock or draw the layout and pipe fittings of the water tank with hard objects at will. If there is any problem, inform the technical maintenance personnel and maintenance welding personnel of the manufacturer in advance. It is required that the professional personnel specialized in argon arc welding work should be engaged in the maintenance, and the water should be discharged. 3. Maintenance personnel shall regularly observe the use of main parts and accessories inside and outside the water tank every month, and report problems to the manufacturer in time. 4. Do not open the manhole cover of water tank at will to prevent secondary pollution of water quality. Clean and disinfect the water tank regularly once or twice a year</p>

              <h3>Brief introduction of installation process of activated carbon filter</h3>
              <p>Do you know about activated carbon filter? How many friends know how to install it? Is the installation of activated carbon filter simple? Which seat is installed in the water pipe? First of all, the air filter is in a black plastic detachable shell at the back of the upper part of the engine, and the active air conditioning filter element is in the glove box on the right side of the dashboard. The air conditioning filter element is inside the glove box before the copilot. Remove the glove box first, and you can see it. It is generally installed at the back of quartz sand filter. Simple installation, equipped with positive and negative washing pipeline. 1) The activated carbon filter is mainly used to remove organic matters, colloidal silicon, residual chlorine (Cl2), etc. in water. It has strong adsorption capacity for odor, chroma and heavy metal ions. Water purification carbon can improve the taste of products. Activated carbon filter is mainly used in mineral water, various pure water processes, swimming pools and other processes for water purification. It has the functions of deodorizing, deodorizing, removing chlorine ions and other organic matters in water. The shell is made of stainless steel or carbon steel, and the filler is water purification activated carbon. According to the adopted technology and packaging form, it can be divided into tank type and tube type. The tank type uses activated carbon particles directly and quartz sand is laid under it, which has high water efficiency, but the regeneration is relatively troublesome. The tube type is formed by adding the activated carbon particles into the binder such as heating and sintering. It is more convenient to use and regenerate. (2) The packing water purification activated carbon water purification activated carbon series is made of high-quality shell or coal as raw materials, advanced equipment, microcomputer control production process conditions and refined processing. The product has developed pore structure, high strength and low impurity content. It has the advantages of proper particle size, small resistance and easy regeneration. It has excellent effect on water purification. It can not only remove the odor of water, improve the purity of water, but also remove various impurities such as chlorine, mercury, chromium, arsenic, lead, pesticides and other harmful substances. It can be widely used to fill all kinds of large, medium and small water purifiers. At present, pure water, mineral water production, and indoor and outdoor air purification are widely used. (3) The application of activated carbon in water treatment has a long history. The first choice of water dechlorination is activated carbon adsorption, which only needs a very short contact time to complete. Therefore, when activated carbon filter is used for dechlorination, the flow rate can reach 10 GPM / ft2 or higher. When activated carbon filter is used to remove odor and odor from water, the adsorption process needs enough contact time, so the working flow rate should not be higher than 5gpm / ft2. The regeneration and backwashing of the activated carbon filter is very important. The backwashing speed should be 10gpm/ft2 for about 10 minutes, followed by the washing and discharging steps for about 5 minutes. The backwashing of activated carbon must be carried out with care as much as possible, otherwise the fragile carbon will be broken and go with the backwashing water flow, and the attachment of these organics will become heavier and heavier and sink to the bottom of the filter, reducing the adsorption capacity of the whole filter. After a period of use, usually a few months to two years, the adsorption capacity of carbon will be exhausted, and the filter bed must be replaced with new activated carbon. Crystal spring water treatment equipment for you to produce high-quality products, provide high-quality after-sales service!</p>

              <h3>Reverse osmosis technology in water treatment process</h3>
              <p>The working principle is as follows: under the action of a pressure greater than its osmotic pressure, the water in the water will pass through a semi permeable membrane and become salt free fresh water; after the salt water is gradually concentrated, it will form concentrated water and discharge equipment. Generally, the reverse osmosis is used for desalination of sea water, preparation of pure water, etc.; it can also be used for separation and recovery fields such as concentration of aqueous solution, etc All right. As the core part of water treatment process, the cost of reverse osmosis equipment is relatively expensive, so when we design the water system, we often use strict pre-treatment protection and system operation parameter control for reverse osmosis. For example, the influent concentration, temperature, pH, substances and colloids that are easy to produce polarization precipitation in the water are under strict and effective control. In addition, the raw water or simulated raw water are input into the imported RO equipment design software for simulation calculation, and the system structure design system is put into operation only after obtaining the best operation parameters. Based on the advanced and strict design, combined with fine processing, it can prevent the pollution and damage of the system, ensure its high quality, high efficiency and long-term stable operation, greatly reduce the operation cost, effectively reduce the labor intensity of the operators, and make the operators save a lot of operation labor and have more energy and time to strengthen the monitoring and control of the system To further improve its performance. Therefore, from the perspective of users' response, the RO system designed by our company can operate safely and reliably for several years after proper operation and maintenance. At present, our company mainly uses the reverse osmosis membrane components produced by American fluid company, ceramic chemical company and heidaneng company. According to the different working pressure of the equipment, the main body of the RO element is divided into ultra-low pressure, low pressure, medium pressure and high pressure elements; according to the different salt content in the water, the element can be simply divided into sea water type, brackish water type and common type; according to the demand of water recovery rate, it can be divided into high recovery rate type and low recovery rate type; according to the different desalination rate, it can be divided into high desalination rate type and low dehydration rate type Salt type. The commonly used specification is 4 (phi; L1000). Its pressure resistant shell is developed by our company with unique structural characteristics. It is made of 316 stainless steel, polished and sprayed with plastic. It has good pressure resistance, convenient installation, not easy to be damaged, beautiful and practical. In recent years, Cangzhou Dingsheng Environmental Protection Engineering Co., Ltd. has introduced a large number of reverse osmosis technology and components at home and abroad, and has provided a large number of reverse osmosis units for the majority of users. The technology is mature and the service is also highly praised by the majority of users.</p>

              <h3>Water treatment equipment safety and environmental protection without side effects</h3>
              <p>Working principle of water treatment equipment when water flows through high-pressure and high-frequency electromagnetic fields, calcium, magnesium ions and bicarbonate ions in the bicarbonate in the water will lose the ability of chemistry, physics and mutual attraction under the action of high-pressure and high-frequency electromagnetic fields, and gradually form crystal clusters to sink into the bottom and discharge with sewage, so as to achieve the purpose of scale prevention. The water treatment equipment is applied to the electrodes at both ends of the reverse osmosis module to make water ions. The ion-exchange resin accelerates the removal of ions to achieve the purified water production resistivity. The ion-exchange resin comes from the high-voltage electricity and is supplied by the dissociation of water, so no acid or alkali is needed for regeneration and reduction. Widely used in all walks of life in the domestic water treatment equipment. Slgp type high frequency electronic water treatment instrument type water treatment instrument, also known as scale removal and anti scaling instrument, is an upgraded product developed on the basis of domestic similar products, which has been continuously improved. The equipment does not need to add any chemicals, and is very simple to install and use. It can be widely used in boilers, central air conditioning, heat exchange equipment, circulating water system, industrial general water treatment equipment, etc. it has obvious prevention and removal effect on physical, biological and chemical scale. It does not change the chemical properties of water and has no side effects on human body. The effect of descaling is obvious. The equipment is installed in the water circulation system. For the original scale with the thickness of less than 2mm, it can gradually loosen and fall off in about 30 days under normal circumstances. The treated scale is granular and can be discharged with the sewage pipeline without blocking the pipeline system. After the old scale falls off, there will be no new scale in a certain range. The equipment is small in size, easy to install and can be used unattended for a long time. After the water flows through the equipment, it can change the water into magnetized water, and has certain inhibition and killing effect on the bacteria in the water.</p>

              <h3>Development trend of water treatment equipment</h3>
              <p>In China, the water purification equipment should be proved by the national standard method, and the people should find a water purification equipment manufacturer with complete operation and protection manual and satisfactory after-sales service to purchase water purification equipment. Each kind of water purification equipment is not omnipotent. Before purchase, you should first understand the function of water purification equipment and the water quality status of the local incoming water, so as not to consume money and get the expected effect. Some water quality can not be used for reverse osmosis and Exfiltration. If the content of chlorine or iron in the water is too high, the membrane may be damaged. If the iron content in the water is too high, it will damage the effect of ultraviolet light killing bacteria water purification equipment. In addition, when using the water purification equipment produced by Zhejiang water treatment equipment, the inlet water temperature should be prevented from being too high. When the temperature of many water purification equipment or filter cores is high, the treatment effect will be poor, and the materials will also be damaged and the service life will be reduced. Users should be careful. Even if the time for changing the filter core is not up, but the surface quality of clean water changes, the taste of the filter core becomes poor or the water production of the system decreases, they should be sure to find out the possible causes, such as improper pipeline connection, cracks in the pipeline or filter core, and if necessary, they should change the pipeline or filter core. In addition, in addition to the operation instructions, if the filter core has become a serious yellowish by the eyes of people, we should think about the change. In the newly used filter core type water purification equipment or water purification unit, use clear water to soak in the water for at least 15 minutes, or rinse with clear water to remove impurities in the filter core. In terms of the pure water system of reverse osmosis and exudation, the pre activated carbon filter core and reverse osmosis and exudation membrane need to be rinsed with water of about 20 liters each to remove carbon particles and residual liquid of reverse osmosis and exudation membrane. The change frequency of the filter core of the water purification equipment can generally be learned from the operation and protection manual provided by the manufacturer, but it must be noted that the water quality conditions and water yield used by the general manufacturer are in the standard state. Users must pay attention to whether the local water quality status and daily water consumption are different from the manufacturer's data. If the higher the concentration of pollutant liquid in the raw water is, the greater the water consumption is, the higher the frequency of changing filter core should be.</p>

              <h3>Filtration principle of activated carbon filtration</h3>
              <p>The adsorption principle of activated carbon is: forming a layer of balanced surface concentration on the surface of its particles, and then adsorbing organic impurities into the activated carbon particles, the adsorption effect is very high at the initial stage of use. However, as time goes on, the adsorption capacity of activated carbon will be weakened to some extent, and the adsorption effect will also decline. If the water quality in the aquarium is turbid and the organic matter content in the water is high, the activated carbon will lose its filtration function soon. Therefore, the activated carbon should be cleaned or replaced regularly. The size of activated carbon particles also has an impact on the adsorption capacity. The smaller the activated carbon particles, the larger the filtration area. Granular activated carbon is not easy to flow due to particle forming, and impurities such as organic matters in water are not easy to block in the filter layer of activated carbon, which has strong adsorption capacity and is easy to carry and replace. The adsorption capacity of activated carbon is directly proportional to the contact time with water. The longer the contact time is, the better the filtered water quality will be. Note: the filtered water should flow out of the filter layer slowly. The new activated carbon should be washed clean before the first use, otherwise there is ink black water flowing out. Before the activated carbon is put into the filter, 2-3cm thick sponge shall be laid at the bottom and top to prevent the algae and other large particle impurities from penetrating. After the activated carbon is used for 3 months, if the filtering effect decreases, the activated carbon shall be replaced with a new one, and the sponge layer shall also be replaced regularly. Activated carbon adsorption filter is a kind of pressure filter device with activated carbon as filter material. It can be connected with ion exchange softening and desalting equipment in series to form a treatment system. Activated carbon adsorption filter not only has the function of ordinary mechanical filter to filter suspended solids, but also can remove free residual chlorine, odor, chroma, organic matter and other impurities which are difficult to be removed by conventional means.</p>

              <h3>Filter element effect of laminated filter</h3>
              <p>Filter element effect of lamination filter element of lamination filter: lamination is a carrier for impurity treatment. It is composed of a group of plastic discs with grooves on both sides in different directions. The edges of grooves on adjacent surfaces form many intersections, which constitute a large number of cavities and irregular channels, which are shrinking from the outside to the inside. During filtration, these paths cause turbulence of water, which eventually causes impurities in water to be intercepted at each intersection. If the disk is superposed and installed on the filter element framework, an outer loose and inner tight filter unit is formed under the pressure of spring and water inlet. In each filter unit, the lamination compressed by spring and water pressure forms a filter screen that numerous impurity particles cannot pass through. The lamination width is 12-14mm, and the lamination material is high-quality engineering plastic with high wear resistance. Supported by stainless steel spring, the structure is firm. The backwash water flows from the inside to the outside along the tangent direction of the inner wall of the lamination, and the lamination rotates under the action of the backwash water flow to ensure that all the dirt is effectively cleaned and discharged. Time intervals and pressure differences can be used to control all steps of back flushing. Once the setting is completed, it can be used for a long time. The automatic backwashing filter can complete the whole automatic backwashing process in a few seconds without interrupting the work. The filter with this filter principle can dynamically change the lamination clearance when filtering and backwashing, which is very beneficial to improve the filtering performance and filter water quality, and can greatly reduce the backwashing water consumption, usually the self consumption is about. The different depth and number of grooves on the disc determine the filtering accuracy of the filtering unit.</p>

              <h3>Three tips for purchasing water purification equipment</h3>
              <p>Recently, there are many disputes on water purifier. Some people say that the more the truth is argued, the more obvious the truth is. Some customers ask about the filter material of their own water purifier and the life of the backwash time. Others don't know the difference between the water purifier and the soft water, and mistakenly associate the scale problem with the water purifier. I found that some people are still in a relatively hazy state of water treatment, so there are several aspects that need to be understood when choosing water treatment equipment: first, look at the material. Modern people know that they need to buy good pipes and pipe fittings for renovation of waterways. After installation, they need to make a pressure test. Water and fire are merciless, which is a crucial thing. So the second thing to look at when choosing a water treatment unit is the tank material. Stainless steel is the best choice for compressive and corrosion resistance. Prices are also relatively high. Food polar resin or PVC has poor compression resistance and low price. Second: fixed function. To choose a water processor, we should first make clear our purpose, first of all, from a large concept, is to purify water or soften water. Purified water is to remove sediment, impurities, bacteria, heavy metals, residual chlorine, organics, and some minerals. Softened water is to remove calcium and magnesium ions in water, the most direct is scale. Generally softened water only needs cation resin to complete ion exchange and remove calcium and magnesium ions. The softened water has the advantages of cleaning the skin, washing clothes soft and smooth, protecting the water heater and faucet, preventing the shower from being blocked by the scale, and no longer having water stains in the sink. It should be noted that it is precisely because of the removal of calcium and magnesium in water, long-term drinking of softened water will cause calcium and magnesium deficiency in human body. Therefore, in addition to the hardness of water quality reaching very hard and extremely hard standards, soft water machine should be used as drinking water processor. It is a wise choice to use water softener as domestic water processor</p>

It is a wise choice to use water softener as domestic water processor</p>
              <p>The purified water is different from the softened water, which needs a lot of different filter materials to achieve the predetermined purification requirements. Each kind of filter material can play a different role in purification. How to reasonably match the composition of filter material is the key. Article 3: filter material selection. At present, the main water purification materials are ppcotton, activated carbon, KDF, ultrafiltration membrane, RO membrane, quartz sand, Maifanshi, infrared mineralized ball, etc. Ppcotton belongs to a kind of polyester cotton, which can filter some coarse impurities and water rust. Because of its short service life and inability to backwash, there are few used water purification materials, which are out of date. Activated carbon is adsorbed by porous structure on the surface of chemical substances, organic pollution sources, color, odor, etc. There are active groups on all surfaces. When organics with different molecular sizes enter the pores, they are firmly adsorbed on the surface and removed from the water. Most of the color and peculiar smell of the water we can feel are caused by organic matters, so the water purified by activated carbon not only removes most of the carcinogenic organic matters, but also makes the water clear and tastes soft and sweet. There is no doubt about the effect of activated carbon on improving the taste, but it should be pointed out that due to the short life of activated carbon, it is necessary to backwash and change the filter material regularly. KDF is a high-purity copper zinc alloy particle. It conducts water treatment through micro electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction. When it contacts with water, two metals in the alloy form numerous small primary battery systems at submicroscopic scale. This material has strong reaction ability and extremely fast reaction speed in water, and can remove up to 99% of chlorine in water and lead, mercury, nickel dissolved in water Chromium and other metal ions and compounds. It has a remarkable effect on inhibiting the growth of bacteria, fungi, dirt and algae. Ultrafiltration membrane is a hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane with exhaust performance. It is popular as a very fine sieve. According to the fine pores on the surface, anything larger than its precision can be filtered, including bacteria, microorganisms, colloids and proteins. The selection of ultrafiltration membrane depends on its accuracy, which is determined by 0. 5 micron -0. 01 microns. The smaller the value is, the better the filtration effect is. The choice of ultrafiltration membrane depends on whether it is an external or internal pressure membrane. Generally speaking, the direction of water flow is from the outside to the inside or from the inside to the outside. The compressive strength of external pressure membrane is better than that of internal pressure membrane, and the thickness of membrane filament should be compared when choosing ultrafiltration membrane. Because the water pressure exceeds the pressure resistance of the ultrafiltration membrane, the membrane will be damaged and fail. The compressive strength of the thick film is better than that of the thin film. I have summarized the problems I have encountered since I studied the water purifier and several factors that should be paid attention to when selecting the crystal spring water treatment equipment for reference.</p>

              <h3>Introduction to substances in water</h3>
              <p>The structure of ionic water is the abbreviation of electrolytically reduced alkaline ionic water. It is the best drinking water for human body. It can help to eliminate all kinds of harmful toxins in human body, neutralize the acid substances in human body, regulate the pH value of human body, maintain it in a weak alkaline healthy constitution, thus preventing the occurrence of various diseases, ensuring the health and vitality of human body, The basic principle of long life, ionic water is: tap water removes chlorine, harmful bacteria, rust and other impurities in the water through high-quality filtration system, and then generates alkaline ionic water and acid ionic water through electrolysis, and divides the large water molecular group into small water molecular group, enhancing the activity, permeability and solubility of water. Suspended matter in water: suspended matter in water is particles with a diameter of about 10-4mm. Visible to the naked eye. These particles are mainly composed of sediment, soil, protozoa, algae, bacteria, viruses, and macromolecular organic matters, which are often suspended in the water flow. The muddy erosion phenomenon of water is also caused by these substances. These particles are very unstable and can be removed by precipitation and filtration. When the water is still, the heavy particles will sink. Light particles will float on the water surface and can be removed by filtration and other separation methods. Colloidal substance in water: colloidal substance in water refers to particles with a diameter of 10-4 ~ 10-6mm. Colloid is a collection of molecules and ions. The mineral colloids in natural water are mainly iron, aluminum and silicon compounds. Organic colloidal substances in water are mainly humic substances formed by the decomposition and decomposition of plant or animal limbs. The humus content in lake water is the most, so it often makes the water yellow green or brown.</p>
