        <h3>Analysis on the corrosion of chemical water treatment equipment and facilities in power plant and the Countermeasures</h3>
        <p>Abstract: the chemical water treatment of power plant can avoid the pollution of waste water to the environment, and improve the utilization rate of plant water, which can be said to be more than one stroke. However, in the treatment process of chemical water equipment and facilities, various chemical changes will cause corrosion to the equipment, thus reducing the service life of the equipment and increasing the cost of water treatment. This paper analyzes the corrosion problems in the process of chemical water treatment and the corresponding treatment methods, mainly including the rubber lining of high acid tank, acid and alkali neutralization tank and channel, and acid adding system of circulating water. Key words: plant chemistry; water treatment equipment; facility corrosion</p>
        <h3>1、 The necessity to deal with the corrosion of chemical water treatment equipment and facilities in power plant</h3>
        <p>1. To reduce the cost of water treatment in theory, the chemical water in the power plant can be reused after treatment, so as to reduce the production cost. However, if the production equipment and facilities are corroded in the process of water purification, it will lead to accelerated aging and scrapping of the equipment, and the production equipment has to be purchased again, which will increase the cost of chemical water treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the corrosion problem in the process of chemical water treatment in power plants, and reduce the corrosion through various technical means to extend the service life of equipment. 2. Reduce the chemical water treatment load most of the chemical water treatment equipment and facilities are made of metal materials. If the chemical water causes corrosion to the equipment itself, some components of the materials that make up the equipment will dissolve into the chemical water, which increases the treatment load of the chemical water invisibly. In addition, the composition and content of the chemical substances produced by the corrosion of production equipment and facilities are uncertain, which will also affect the water treatment plan. Therefore, the corroded equipment and facilities should be treated in time to avoid the increase of chemical water treatment workload.</p>
        <h3>2、 Corrosion of chemical water treatment equipment and facilities in power plant and Countermeasures</h3>
        <p>（1） Study on the problem of high acid tank lining corrosion there are many kinds of chemical substances in the chemical water of power plant, among which acid and alkali will cause different degrees of corrosion to the water treatment equipment, and the salt in the chemical water will also have some chemical reactions with the metal equipment. All of these seriously affect the life of water treatment equipment, and then improve the cost of water treatment. Therefore, the corrosion of equipment should not be ignored, especially the corrosion of high-level acid tank. First of all, it is necessary to effectively prevent the corrosion of water treatment equipment and facilities. For the chemical water treatment equipment and facilities of power plant, the rubber lining of high-level acid tank is the most severely corroded, so it is necessary to do a good job of corrosion prevention before the equipment is put into use. Second, the equipment and facilities that have been corroded should be treated in time to avoid the deep damage of the equipment. The corrosion of chemical water treatment equipment and facilities in the power plant is mainly caused by chemical reaction on the surface of the equipment. If the chemical reaction is not timely inhibited or the corrosion wound is timely treated, the chemical corrosion will go deep layer by layer, eventually leading to the corrosion or perforation of the equipment and facilities. In a word, we should attach great importance to the corrosion of the rubber lining of the high-level acid tank, focusing on prevention, combining prevention and control, regular inspection and timely repair. The treatment methods to prevent the lining layer corrosion of high acid tank mainly include the following points. First, the chemical reagents used in the chemical water treatment process should avoid the corrosion of the lining layer, so before purchasing, it is necessary to understand the composition of the lining layer, analyze the chemical reagents to be purchased, consider the reaction possibility and reaction conditions between the chemical reagents and the lining layer, and ensure that the chemical reagents will not have the corrosion effect on the lining layer before purchasing. Second, the quality and purity of hydrochloric acid should be ensured when purchasing hydrochloric acid. Before putting into use, the composition of hydrochloric acid should be analyzed to avoid impurities caused by long-term storage, which will corrode the rubber lining layer of high-level tank. Third, clean the pipeline, production tank and cation bed where hydrochloric acid flows, so as to avoid the reaction of impurities in the pipeline with hydrochloric acid and corrosion of the high-level tank. The treatment methods for the corrosion of the lining layer of the high-level acid tank include the following aspects. First, in the process of chemical water treatment, it is found that the high-level acid tank is corroded, so it is necessary to overflow the chemical water to avoid water corrosion of the acid tank. Second, if it is found that the water treatment equipment and facilities are severely corroded during maintenance, they shall be replaced in time to avoid safety accidents. Third, if there are toxic substances in the chemical water, the staff should do a good job in safety protection, observe the corrosion of the high-level tank at the same time, find the instantaneous corrosion, have an emergency plan, and stop the operation of the equipment if necessary. （2） Corrosion problems in acid-base neutralization tank and channel and their treatment methods acid-base neutralization tank and corresponding channel are also the focus of corrosion of chemical water treatment equipment in power plant. Acid and alkali neutralization tank, not only its component acid or alkali has corrosive effect on the equipment, when the acid and alkali reaction is exothermic, it will accelerate the chemical reaction rate of corrosion, thus aggravating the corrosion phenomenon. In addition, it is difficult to accurately control the amount of chemical reagents added during acid-base neutralization, so after neutralization reaction, there may be acid or alkali surplus, and then continue to corrode the equipment. It is found that the main reason of corrosion in acid alkali neutralization tank is that the anti-corrosion work is not in place. Generally, the neutralization tank is made of granite, and its main component is calcium carbonate. If it encounters acid, it will react quickly, and then corrosion will occur. Therefore, when building the pool, it is necessary to avoid the cracks between the granite, even if there are cracks, they should be properly handled. However, due to the inadequate work of the anti-corrosion construction personnel, the quality of the anti-corrosion project is not up to the standard, and finally the equipment and facilities of the acid-base neutralization tank are corroded. In addition, in the repair work of equipment, the repair quality is worrying, which also causes the equipment to suffer from corrosion for many times. The prevention and control of the corrosion of the chemical water treatment equipment and facilities in the power plant mainly starts from the following two points. First, in the construction of acid and alkali neutralization tank, the quality control shall be strictly controlled to avoid corrosion of equipment in the future water treatment process. Second, quality and quantity shall be guaranteed during equipment overhaul and maintenance to make each overhaul valuable. Third, the chemical reaction of acid, alkali and salt usually takes place in the water environment. It is necessary to keep good ventilation in the waste water tank and ditch, so as to avoid corrosion.</p>
        <p>3） From the current situation, when the chemical water treatment of power plant is carried out, the circulating water acid dosing system is very easy to have problems, mainly in the following two aspects. First, material. In the acid adding system of circulating water, if the material of equipment and facilities has some problems, it will be seriously corroded. Since sulfuric acid is mainly used for circulating water adding acid, it is necessary to select materials with strong sulfuric acid resistance when selecting materials, so as to ensure that chemical water treatment equipment and facilities have stronger corrosion resistance. Second, installation process. During the construction and installation of circulating water acid dosing system, if there are corresponding problems in the installation process, it will also cause chemical water treatment equipment and facilities to be corroded, and may cause environmental pollution and production accidents due to the leakage of production equipment. Therefore, during the construction and installation of the circulating water acid dosing system, it is necessary to ensure the water tank is in place first, and then carry out the corresponding water filling test. Only after the test results are accurate can the pipes be connected together. Due to the influence of external factors, the pipeline of circulating water acid adding system is prone to rust, so effective measures should be taken to prevent rust outside the pipeline. The anti-corrosion work of the circulating water acid adding system should be started from the following two aspects. First, the control of the way of dosing. When chemicals are added to the chemical water treatment process of the power plant, corresponding control work also needs to be done. Because if the chemical control is not reasonable, it is easy to make the pH value of chemical water fluctuate greatly, which is easy to lead to the corrosion of chemical water treatment equipment and facilities. Therefore, in the process of production, it is necessary to do a good job in the control of dosing. At present, the best dosing control method used is the metering pump control method, because the use of the metering pump can better control the amount of acid added and the concentration of medicine added, so as to effectively control the pH value of the solution, so as to avoid the corrosion of equipment and facilities. Second, the way to deal with the corrosion of the carbon remover body and air duct. If the body of the carbon remover is corroded, the corroded place shall be polished until the metal surface is exposed, and then the surface shall be cleaned and coated with anti-corrosion paint. When the first layer of anticorrosive coating is dry, another layer of anticorrosive coating needs to be applied. If it is found that the air duct is corroded, it is necessary to cut off the position where the air duct is connected with the carbon remover. After cutting off, it is necessary to re weld and connect the air duct with the body of the carbon remover. 3、 Conclusion to sum up, the chemical water treatment equipment and facilities in the power plant are severely corroded, but there are corresponding treatment methods for each corrosion. In the process of chemical water treatment, the causes of corrosion are different in different treatment processes, and the equipment used in different treatment processes are also different. Therefore, relevant workers of water treatment should be familiar with the equipment and facilities in their own work section, understand the components of the treated chemical water, and have solid chemical basic knowledge. In addition, work records shall be made, and comprehensive analysis shall be carried out on equipment corrosion, chemical water composition, equipment maintenance, etc. on a regular basis, so as to finally formulate an effective corrosion prevention plan.

        <h3>Since October, these new water treatment policies have been put into effect!</h3>
        <p>The golden week slipped away in the "shopping, eating and eating". Although we are looking forward to another Lunar birthday for our mother, we still have to accept the fact that we have started work. Dream (poor) makes me full of motivation! During the "whoosh" holiday, several water treatment policies have been implemented, and there are still some policies to be implemented in the next two months of this year. Next, let's take stock of the water treatment policies that have been implemented since October.</p>

        <h3>Attention should be paid to the use of parameter returning equipment</h3>
        <p>Release time: 14-6-10<br>As a highly automatic purification equipment, reverse osmosis equipment should pay attention to the loss of equipment in use and do a good job in daily maintenance. The reverse osmosis equipment requires tap water as the water source, most users will directly connect the reverse osmosis equipment with tap water for use, and do not consider the reserved cleaning port during installation. In addition, due to the high degree of automation of the equipment, users often think that it can be like other household equipment when using, as long as the power is turned on and off, lack of special management, and use process There is no operation record or incomplete record in Zhongduo.The operation of reverse osmosis equipment is mostly intermittent, and there is no proper maintenance measures, until the water production of the equipment is very small or the TDS is very high, problems are found, but it is too late, at this time, measures are taken, usually the performance of the equipment can only recover to 60% - 70% level, which has caused permanent loss; problems are often found in the peak period of production, which often results in shutdown and unnecessary economic loss.In addition to the above, the following factors should be paid attention to before using the reverse osmosis equipment: first of all, because most of the reverse osmosis equipment currently uses low-pressure polyamide membrane, which is not chlorine resistant in use, especially under the action of heavy metal ions, it is easy to oxidize and cause permanent damage. Therefore, a set of residual chlorine colorimeter must be prepared for determination Chlorine content in water to avoid unnecessary loss caused by corrosion of reverse osmosis membrane.Second, the tap water contains more heavy metal ions. After the activated carbon fails, it is easy to damage the reverse osmosis membrane. Therefore, it is necessary to check the equipment frequently and replace the activated carbon. It should be noted that the content of residual chlorine and organic matter in tap water is variable, which is not enough only by calculation and estimation. The failure of activated carbon should be subject to the test, so as to avoid the waste of early replacement and the membrane damage caused by too late replacement.</p>

        <h3>Brief introduction of ultrafiltration device</h3>
        <p>Release time: 14-6-10<br>Ultrafiltration device is a common sewage purification and treatment device, which adopts pressurized membrane separation technology, that is, under a certain pressure, the solvent and various small solutes contained in the feed liquid pass through the filter membrane from the high-pressure feed liquid side to the low-pressure side, so as to obtain the permeate liquid or ultrafiltration liquid. The micropores of the ultrafiltration membrane can be up to 0.01 μ m (one thousandth of a millimeter), which can effectively remove the water Under the action of particles, colloids, bacteria, heat source and organic matter, the solute molecules with larger size than the pore diameter of the membrane are intercepted by the membrane to be concentrated solution.The basic principle of the ultrafiltration device is to use asymmetric microporous structure and semi permeable membrane medium at a certain pressure and flow rate at room temperature, rely on the pressure difference on both sides of the membrane as the driving force, filter in a cross flow mode, so that the solvent and small molecular substances pass through, and the large molecular substances and particles such as protein, water-soluble polymers, bacteria, etc. are blocked by the filter membrane, so as to achieve separation, classification A new membrane separation technology for purification and concentration.Ultrafiltration is a pressure driven membrane separation process. The separation range of ultrafiltration membrane is macromolecular materials and colloidal properties with a relative molecular weight of 5-1 million, and the diameter of corresponding particles is 0.005-0.1 & mu; M. the separation mechanism is generally considered that the mechanical screening ultrafiltration membrane module has a plate type and roll type ultrafiltration membrane for water purification.Concentration polarization is a natural phenomenon in membrane separation process. How to minimize this phenomenon is one of the important topics in ultrafiltration technology. At present, the measures taken are: ① increasing the flow velocity of membrane surface to reduce the thickness of boundary layer, and making the retained solute be taken away from water in time; ② adopting physical or chemical washing measures.</p>

        <h3>Brief introduction of ion exchanger</h3>
        <p>Release time: 14-6-10<br>Ion exchanger is a common purification and treatment equipment in industrial production water treatment, which is mainly used in boiler, thermal power station, chemical industry, light industry, textile, medicine, biology, electronics, atomic energy and the pre-treatment of pure water treatment. It can also be used in the occasions of hard water softening and deionized water preparation required by industrial production, decolorization and purification of food and medicine, return of precious metals and chemical raw materials Collection, electroplating wastewater treatment, etc.The ion exchanger is divided into sodium ion exchanger, anion and cation bed, mixed bed and other types. The principle of the ion exchanger is a traditional water treatment process by which various anions and cations in the water are replaced by anion and cation exchange resins. The anion and cation exchange resins in the ion exchanger can be combined according to different proportions to form an ion exchange cation bed system and an ion exchange anion bed system And ion exchange mixed bed (double bed) system, and mixed bed (double bed) system is usually used in reverse osmosis and other water treatment processes to produce ultra pure water, high-purity water terminal process, it is currently used to prepare ultra pure water, high-purity water can not be replaced by one of the means.Ion exchanger is easy to be corroded in the process of sewage treatment, which can be divided into two categories: overall corrosion and local corrosion. The former occurs evenly on all surfaces of the equipment, while the latter only occurs locally, such as pitting corrosion, crevice corrosion, intergranular corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, corrosion fatigue, hydrogen corrosion cracking, wear corrosion, delamination corrosion, etc., especially in the petroleum, chemical industry and marine atmospheric environment. Therefore, attention should be paid to daily maintenance and repair in the use process, in a timely manner Replace parts to ensure normal operation of ion exchanger.</p>

        <p>Release time: 14-6-10<br>Water is one of the precious resources for human survival. In the pharmaceutical process, water is an indispensable auxiliary raw material. The purity of water used in pharmaceutical directly affects the efficacy of drugs. Therefore, the higher the purity of water used in pharmaceutical, the better. In recent years, with the increasing demand of purified water for medical infusion, pharmaceutical preparations, biological preparations and other production water, purified water equipment has gradually entered our vision to meet the needs of various industries for the production of purified water.The product standard of purified water equipment is very strict. The whole system is composed of all stainless steel materials, and the sterilization device must be equipped before the water point. The purified water equipment adopts the latest technologies such as reverse osmosis, EDI, etc., and designs a complete set of high-purity water treatment process in a targeted way. Therefore, the water produced by the purified water equipment meets the requirements of pharmaceutical purified water in Pharmacopoeia of the people's Republic of China (2005 Edition), so as to meet the requirements of pharmaceutical plants and hospitals for the production of purified water and large-scale infusion.Purified water equipment is used to produce purified water.

        <h3>Introduction to multi media filter</h3>
        <p>Release time: 14-6-10<br>As the name suggests, the multi-media filter is a process that uses a variety of filter media to pass the water with high turbidity through a certain thickness of granular or non granular materials under a certain pressure, so as to effectively remove the suspended impurities and clarify the water. The commonly used filter media are quartz sand, anthracite, manganese sand, etc., which are mainly used for water treatment, turbidity removal, softened water, and pre stage pretreatment of pure water Li et al. Due to the use of a variety of filter media, the ability of impurity filtration has been greatly improved, so the turbidity of the effluent can reach below 3 degrees.The selection of multi-media filter can be based on the filter layer design in the filter. The main factors considered in the filter layer design are: 1. Different filter materials have large density difference, so as to ensure that there will be no mixing phenomenon after backwashing disturbance; 2. Select filter materials according to the purpose of water production; 3. The particle size of lower filter materials is required to be smaller than that of upper filter materials, so as to ensure the effectiveness of lower filter materials and To make full use of it, special attention should be paid to that if it is domestic water, the filter medium is generally prohibited to use anthracite, resin and other materials, so as to avoid harm to the body.In addition to choosing the multi-media filter to refer to the filter layer design of the filter, the backwashing effect of the multi-media filter is also a very important basis, because in the process of using the filter, the suspended matter in the raw water is intercepted and absorbed by the filter material layer and accumulates in the filter material layer continuously, so the pore of the filter layer is gradually blocked by the dirt, the filter cake is formed on the surface of the filter layer, and the filter head is lost The loss is increasing, so when the accumulated dirt reaches a certain limit, the filter medium needs to be cleaned in time to restore the working performance of the filter layer and extend the use time of the filter medium.</p>

        <h3>Brief introduction of iron and manganese removal filter</h3>
        <p>Release time: 14-6-10<br>We all know that if drinking water fails to meet the health standards, the harm will be great. In our country, the health standards for drinking water are very strict. Among them, it is stipulated that the iron content in water should be less than 0.3 mg / L, and the manganese content should be less than 0.1 mg / L. if drinking water with high iron and manganese content for a long time will cause adverse effects on people's health. Water with high iron and manganese content will not only It is harmful to people's health and unqualified water in industrial production. High content of water will affect the quality of products such as textile, papermaking, brewing, food, etc. and produce spots on articles. Therefore, it is necessary to remove iron and manganese.The iron and manganese removal filter is applicable to the raw water quality with iron content not more than 15mg / L, manganese content not more than 10mg / L and pH value not less than 6.0. The principle adopted by the iron and manganese removal filter for water purification is to fill enough O2 or O3 into the underground water, and the function of the special catalytic membrane (MnO2 and gamma formed by manganese and iron in the water on the gravel; - FeO (OH) precipitation) distributed on the filter layer of the manganese sand filter Then the low-cost iron and manganese in the water are oxidized to the compound precipitate of high-cost iron and manganese. This kind of high-cost precipitate is retained in the filter layer, and the iron and manganese content of the effluent meets the standard requirements.The iron and manganese removal filter can be divided into manual type and full-automatic type according to the control type. The manual type mainly controls the operation, positive washing and back washing of the filter through the adjustment of the valve. The full-automatic type controls the operation, positive washing and back washing of the filter through the fleet automatic head. According to the tank material, it can be divided into FRP tank, carbon steel tank and stainless steel tank. The inner wall of the tank can be controlled according to the Users require to apply epoxy coating or rubber lining for anticorrosion. After several years of development, the iron and manganese removal filter for food, beverage, textile, papermaking, brewing industry, treatment of water containing excessive iron, groundwater and well water are the first choice for iron and manganese removal and purification of water quality.</p>

        <h3>Principle and advantages of laminated filter</h3>
        <p>Release time: 14-6-10<br>The laminated filter has a long history. In order to meet the needs of B-17 bomber hydraulic oil filtration in World War II, the British invented the laminated filter. The original lamination is made of stainless steel and copper. The two sides of the lamination are machined into tiny grooves. A group of laminations are stacked to form a hollow cylinder to form a filter element. With the end of the war and the development of science and technology, the development and production of various new materials and control technology, the laminated filter has changed from military to civil use.After several years of development, the laminated filter has been widely used in developed countries. Because it can work accurately and stably under rather harsh conditions and has a small footprint and little maintenance, it is widely used in irrigation, wastewater treatment, sewage regeneration, municipal water supply, water plant, large power plants, chemical enterprises, emergency filtering and other fields.The laminated filter, like other filters, is also composed of filter shell and filter element; the filter shell material is generally plastic, or stainless steel, or coated with plastic carbon steel, with many shapes; the filter element shape is a hollow cylinder, which is composed of many circular plastic sheets with micron level regular triangle groove on both sides and assembled on the central framework. In each filter unit, the lamination compressed by spring and water pressure forms numerous filter screens that cannot be passed by impurities. The total thickness is equivalent to 30 layers of ordinary filter screens. In addition, filter discs with different precision can be selected according to the water requirements. There are various specifications such as 20 μ m, 55 μ m, 100 μ m, 130 μ m, 200 μ m, 400 μ m, and the filtration ratio is greater than 85%.In addition to the high filtering accuracy, the other advantage of the laminated filter is that it can completely backwash, and can complete the entire automatic backwash process in a few seconds without interrupting the work. The backwashing is automatically started by the set time or pressure difference signal, the backwashing valve changes the flow direction in the filter unit, the spring on the filter element is forced open by water pressure, and all the small pores between the discs and discs are loosened. The nozzle located in the center of the filter element sprays water along the tangent direction to make the disc rotate. Under the action of the washing of the water flow and the centrifugal force of the high-speed rotation of the disc, the objects retained on the disc are washed out. Therefore, a good cleaning effect can be achieved with a small amount of self consumption water. Because the laminated filter can be automatically backwashed, it hardly needs routine maintenance, inspection and special tools, and there are few detachable parts.</p>
